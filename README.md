### Why are you seeing this here?

Well, I’ve been learning a bunch of random stuff, and I figured, why not toss all this scattered knowledge into one place? So, this repo was born from the Land between where countless ideas are buried and never to be seen again.

At the time of writing this, I’m super motivated, running on caffeine and sheer hope that I’ll actually finish what I started. But let’s be honest, there may come a time when you (or I) realize this repo hasn’t been updated in forever. If that happens, just assume I’m deep into a DOTA2 or wasting time on some other random game.

Anyway, this project is an attempt at building an online E-Commerce shop called FlashMart. It’s powered by microservices and packed with all the cutting-edge tech buzzwords you can imagine.

### Consideration :
I’m currently tinkering with the fundamentals and design. Once I manage to get at least one component to run without setting my computer on fire, I’ll update the README.
